# Dunder Mifflin Internal Web App

Welcome! This is a school project we created as our final project of the 3rd year. It is a internal app for a company, including product, sales and employee update abilities. It uses a mySQL database and is written in plain PHP, with some JS to add interactivity for search or toasts when doing something.
